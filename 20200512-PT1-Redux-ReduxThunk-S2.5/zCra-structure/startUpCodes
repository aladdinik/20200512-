/* For Nicolas normalized.css : */

1+ Run and update everything (ONLY IF YOU DID NOT DOWNLOAD THE ONE ABOVE)!!!! (however you could still download again if you not visted the cra for a while)
	npm install && npm i --save normalize.css && npm i --save serve && npm i --save axios && npm i react-app-polyfill && npm i --save prop-types && npm i --save react-router && npm i --save redux && npm i --save react-redux && npm update && npm audit fix && exit
>>
2+ import 'normalize.css';
>>
3+ remove all css codes in ./src/index.css and you will write your own personal css within it.

/*add in index.js for instance, preferably before everything else)*/

/* updating package.json */
	1+ in script include:
"ikupdate": "npm install && npm update && npm audit fix && exit",
"ikserve": "serve -s build"
	=eg. as this will allow you to serve your build folder after you use npm run build .

/*If you want browser support for IE11 (and maybe IE9 and IE10) */
1+ npm install react-app-polyfill
2+ import 'react-app-polyfill/ie11';   =VIP on the first line of ./src/index.js
	+\  if you also want IE9 and IE10 support than replace "ie11" with "ie9" as this will support all three IE.
+\ if you want language features than check their page for code as it does the same thing but some other things to which I do not know much about, however their was some inconsistency which is why I did not include it here, iK read my note3 docs for more details.

/* For your personal css grid template */

1+ create a css folder and bring your personal grid css template './oikGrid.css'; to the folder
2+ import './css/oikGrid.css';  onto the ./src/index.js file. Preferably before import './index.css';
3+ from you main html files copy both <div> body wrapper , than <header> / <main> / <footer> and paste it in the render App.js file (or what ever file is your top-level component). 
	+\ this will set up the css grid and ./oikGrid.css file.
	+\ %%%%%
<React.StrictMode>
	<div id="background_image">
		<div id="body_wrapper">
			<header id="main_header" role="banner">

				iKheader working

			</header>
			<main id="main_page" role="main">

				iKmain working

			</main>
			<footer id="main_footer" role="contentinfo">

				iKfooter working

			</footer>
		</div>
	</div>
</React.StrictMode>
	=eg. use this as part of your main react html elements.
		+\ You can remove strict mode if you want, but best keep it for now.
			+\ do not forget you perhaps you would want to use context object api as your HOC.

/* Using your kIK.js personal js codes */

+\  if you want to use your personal js file kiK.js , than include it in the ./src folder .
	1+ Put export in the kiK.js file
		+\  eg. export const IK = (function(root) { â€¦
	2+ import {IK} from './kiK.js';  on whatever .js file you want to use it on.
	+\  BIM however it is probably best not to include it in your project as you will likely not be using all those function. 
		+\  so it is best recommended to take snippets codes for when you need them.

/* favicon.ico and logo192 file for <title> */

1+ ./public folder replace favicon.ico file with an image you want for the <title> . Do so by renaming the image file favicon.ico
2+ check ./public/manifest.json file and make sure favicon.ico section details is correct.
+\  do the same for logo192.png file too.
+\  iK? I think you could remove ./public/logo512.png file since I do not know what it is doing.

/*jest unit testing */

+\  create a new folder just for test. And move App.test.js into it.
	+\  you can rename it or modify it as you see fit.
	+\  iK try using the default jest unit testing. But if you cannot than you can do install chai and sinon to make it easier for you.
		+\  not ideal to use mocha yet, since you have to npm run eject create react app.
	+\  copy and paste the test syntax structure from your file so that you have a good idea what the test structure could be like first, plus saving you time typing.
